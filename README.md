# Sorting Visualization

This project provides a visualization of different sorting algorithms using C++ and OpenCV. The visualizations help to understand how sorting algorithms work by showing the sorting process step by step.

## Features

- **Selection Sort Visualization**
- **Bubble Sort Visualization**
- **High-quality GIF output**

## Dependencies

To build and run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- C++11 or later
- CMake
- OpenCV
- FFmpeg (for creating GIFs)
